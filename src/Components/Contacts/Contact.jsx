                    But unfortunately, college isn’t cheap — many programs can cost a small fortune that could take you years to pay back after graduation.

                    That’s where scholarships, and other forms of financial aid, can really make a difference. Scholarships can reduce the amount you pay for college, which means you’ll have a lot less to pay back after you graduate. Keep reading to learn where you can find the best video game scholarships, and find out how to make sure your application has the best shot at getting accepted.
