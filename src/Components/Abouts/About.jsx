                        Does any of this sound familiar?
                        “I’m so passionate about making games my career, but where do I begin? I really want this but have no clue where to start.”
                        “I hate my current job, but could a career in games really support my family? Or have I missed the bus?”
                        “I sent my resume to 10 different game studios, but none have responded. Is this hopeless? What am I doing wrong?”
                        If so, you’ve come to the right place.

                        When you’re thinking about a career in games, there’s so much to learn. It can get overwhelming. You need to find a career that fits your personality, learn the job skills, write a convincing resume, build an epic online portfolio, ace the phone screen… and that’s all before you even get an interview. It’s enough to leave you buried under a mountain of fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

                        That’s where I can help. Think of Game Industry Career Guide as your magical cheat sheet for learning about the game industry, landing your first job, and starting a fulfilling (and profitable!) career making video games.

                        After spending more than 15 years in the video game industry, I’ve learned exactly what game studios look for in job applications and interviews. And I’m sharing this insider information from my own career, along with dozens of my game industry friends, so you can follow your passion and start your dream job: making video games.
